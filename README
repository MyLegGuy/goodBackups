About
-----
Given a database destination file and as many folder paths as you want:
It looks through the folder. 
If a certain file's name is in the database, it hashes it and compares its hash to the one in the database. If it's wrong, it tells you.
If a certian file's name isn't in the database, it hahes it and adds it to the database.
Once it's done looking through the folder, it looks for all database entries that were not used. Those files were missing from the folder.
It checks the other folders you supplied and see if they have the missing files. If so, the files are copied and verified.
This process repeats for all other folders supplied.
