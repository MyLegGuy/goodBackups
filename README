Goals:

(feature 1)
Have two copies of the same files
Hash primary copies and backup copies
Compare hash of backup files to database
Compare hash of primary files to database

(feature 2)
Any files from primary copy not in database are hashed, copied to backup, and hashed again, and added to database.
This is also the function used to init a backup

(feature 3?)
copy all hash tags to database

things to consider:
what to do aboue hashes in filenames? copy them to hash database? But then do they need to stay in the filename after that?
I like the idea that, no matter what, as long as I keep the filename, I'll have the hash. But then should hashes be put on every filename? That could break things. Maybe only for certian filetypes?
